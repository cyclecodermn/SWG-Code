Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front. 

Front3("Microsoft") -> "MicMicMic"
Front3("Chocolate") -> "ChoChoCho"
Front3("at") -> "atatat"

public string Front3(string str) {

}
