We have a loud talking parrot. The "hour" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0..23. We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Return true if we are in trouble. 

ParrotTrouble(true, 6) -> true
ParrotTrouble(true, 7) -> false
ParrotTrouble(false, 6) -> false

public boolean ParrotTrouble(boolean isTalking, int hour) {
