We'll say that a 1 immediately followed by a 3 in an array is an "unlucky" 1. 
Return true if the given array contains an unlucky 1 in the first 2 or last 2 positions in the array. 

Unlucky1({1, 3, 4, 5}) -> true
Unlucky1({2, 1, 3, 4, 5}) -> true
Unlucky1({1, 1, 1}) -> false

public boolean Unlucky1(int[] numbers) {

}
