Given 2 int arrays, a and b, return a new array length 2 containing, as much as will fit, the elements from a followed by the elements from b. The arrays may be any length, including 0, but there will be 2 or more elements available between the 2 arrays. 

Make2({4, 5}, {1, 2, 3}) -> {4, 5}
Make2({4}, {1, 2, 3}) -> {4, 1}
Make2({}, {1, 2}) -> {1, 2}

public int[] make2(int[] a, int[] b) {
  
}
