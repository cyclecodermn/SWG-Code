Given an "out" string length 4, such as "<<>>", and a word, return a 
new string where the word is in the middle of the out string, e.g. "<<word>>".

Hint: Substrings are your friend here 

InsertWord("<<>>", "Yay") -> "<<Yay>>"
InsertWord("<<>>", "WooHoo") -> "<<WooHoo>>"
InsertWord("[[]]", "word") -> "[[word]]"

public string InsertWord(string container, string word) {

}
