Given a string, return the count of the number of times that a substring length 2 appears in the string and also as the last 2 chars of the string, so "hixxxhi" yields 1 (we won't count the end substring). 

CountLast2("hixxhi") -> 1
CountLast2("xaxxaxaxx") -> 1
CountLast2("axxxaaxx") -> 2

public int CountLast2(string str) {

}
