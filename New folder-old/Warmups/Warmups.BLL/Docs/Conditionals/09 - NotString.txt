Given a string, return a new string where "not " has been added to the front. However, if the string already begins with "not", return the string unchanged.

Hint: Look up how to use "SubString" in c#

NotString("candy") -> "not candy"
NotString("x") -> "not x"
NotString("not bad") -> "not bad"

public string NotString(string s) {

}
