Given three ints, a b c, return true if b is greater than a, and c is greater than b. However, with the exception that if "bOk" is true, b does not need to be greater than a. 

AreInOrder(1, 2, 4, false) → true
AreInOrder(1, 2, 1, false) → false
AreInOrder(1, 1, 2, true) → true

public boolean AreInOrder(int a, int b, int c, boolean bOk) {
  
}
