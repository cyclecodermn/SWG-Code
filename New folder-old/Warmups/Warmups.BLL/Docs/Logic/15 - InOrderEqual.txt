Given three ints, a b c, return true if they are in strict increasing order, such as 2 5 11, or 5 6 7, but not 6 5 7 or 5 5 7. However, with the exception that if "equalOk" is true, equality is allowed, such as 5 5 7 or 5 5 5. 

InOrderEqual(2, 5, 11, false) → true
InOrderEqual(5, 7, 6, false) → false
InOrderEqual(5, 5, 7, true) → true

public boolean InOrderEqual(int a, int b, int c, boolean equalOk) {
  
}
